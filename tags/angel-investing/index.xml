      <description>Since my first post about angel investing, I have made the following investments. These all happen to be YC W18 companies.
Vena Medical This company makes a camera that is small enough to fit inside blood vessels, providing a unique perspective to physicians.
Playbook This company makes an app to find other people to do things with. For example, you can find someone in the area who is also interested in playing basketball and do that together.</description>

      <description>I started angel investing. I have two investments so far.
Sickweather This company has an app you can download to see what kind of sicknesses are going around in your area. You can also report what you have when you get sick.
Anyplace This company lets you live in a hotel on a month-to-month contract as an alternative to a traditional apartment lease. Also you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with furniture and utilities as you would with an apartment.</description>

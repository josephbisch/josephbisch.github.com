      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my first package uploaded to Debian this week. That package is winetricks. It was orphaned and I adopted it. Now the lastest version (0.0+20140818+svn1202) is available in sid and should migrate to testing in nine days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Debconf14 was the first Debconf I attended. It was an awesome experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debconf14 started with a Meet and Greet before the Welcome Talk. I got to meet people and find out what they do for Debian. I also got to meet other GSoC students that I had only previously interacted with online. During the Meet and Greet I also met one of my mentors for GSoC, Zack. Later in the conference I met another of my mentors, Piotr. Previously I only interacted with Zack and Piotr online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a couple of months since my last GSoC update and a lot has happened since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://metrics.debian.net&#34;&gt;view the web interface at metrics.debian.net&lt;/a&gt;. There is a dynamic interface viewable with JavaScript enabled, and a static interface viewable with JS disabled. I am currently working on the dynamic interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

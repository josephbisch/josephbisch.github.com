      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a spreadsheet to do compound interest and retirement calculations with increasing contributions (i.e. to account for salary increases over time). There are online calculators that do so, but I wanted it in spreadsheet form, so I could add to it.
So I made the following spreadsheet that compares the difference that a certain yearly salary increase makes on the value of your portfolio and on the amount of income you can draw from that portfolio based on a certain withdrawal rate.</description>

      <description>Since my first post about angel investing, I have made the following investments. These all happen to be YC W18 companies.
Vena Medical This company makes a camera that is small enough to fit inside blood vessels, providing a unique perspective to physicians.
Playbook This company makes an app to find other people to do things with. For example, you can find someone in the area who is also interested in playing basketball and do that together.</description>

      <description>I started angel investing. I have two investments so far.
Sickweather This company has an app you can download to see what kind of sicknesses are going around in your area. You can also report what you have when you get sick.
Anyplace This company lets you live in a hotel on a month-to-month contract as an alternative to a traditional apartment lease. Also you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with furniture and utilities as you would with an apartment.</description>

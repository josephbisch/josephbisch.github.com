Sickweather This company has an app you can download to see what kind of sicknesses are going around in your area. You can also report what you have when you get sick.
Anyplace This company lets you live in a hotel on a month-to-month contract as an alternative to a traditional apartment lease. Also you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with furniture and utilities as you would with an apartment.</description>

    <h2>Namecoin</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This page is mostly about my contributions to Namecoin.</p>
    <h3>My Start</h3>
    <p>My contributions to Namecoin started when I began working on adding Namecoin currency support to Armory. I had a question that I asked some Namecoin developers. From there I stuck around and worked on some other Namecoin projects.</p>
    <h3>The Projects</h3>
    <p>My Armory repository ended up <a href="https://github.com/namecoin/BitcoinArmory">getting forked</a> by the official Namecoin GitHub account. I also worked (or am working) on some stuff related to NMControl, most notably Python 3 support and an Android version called <a href="https://github.com/josephbisch/nmcontrolandroid">NMControl for Android</a>. I am also part of the group looking into build automation and reproducibility for Namecoin software.</p>

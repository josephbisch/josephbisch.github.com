A couple days ago I received my welcome package from Google. The welcome package included a pen and a notepad that has stickers.

Since my last update I got the repo setup and started working on the specifications. I have been emailing with my mentors to work out the specs.

You can [view the git repo](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/josephbisch-guest/debmetrics.git;a=summary).

To keep up to date on my progress, you can either read this blog, or you can read the [soc-corrdination mailing list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/soc-coordination) once coding starts on the 19th.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new laptop. It is the HP Pavilion 15t. The model number is 15t-ab100 and the SKU is L8V46AV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the i5 processor with 8 GB RAM and 1 TB HDD. It was a big upgrade over my old laptop, because I had a first gen i3 in the old one and this has a Skylake processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially tried running Debian via LiveCD on the laptop, but it was an uphill battle getting the newer hardware working. I could have built the latest kernel myself on Debian, but I opted to install Arch. Most of the hardware ended up working fine with the 4.3.1 kernel that was in Arch testing at the time. I still ended up compiling the 4.4.0-rc3 kernel to get the very last outstanding hardware working, such as HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to enable the virtualization option in the UEFI if you are going to use KVM.&lt;/p&gt;

    <p>I got a new laptop. It is the HP Pavilion 15t. The model number is 15t-ab100 and the SKU is L8V46AV. I got the i5 processor with 8 GB RAM and 1 TB HDD. It was a big upgrade over my old laptop, because I had a first gen i3 in the old one and this has a Skylake processor. I initially tried running Debian via LiveCD on the laptop, but it was an uphill battle getting the newer hardware working.</p>

    <p>This article assumes familiarity with the Bitcoin block format. Namecoin blocks starting with block 19200 may have some extra data in them. These blocks with extra data are called AuxPOW blocks for Auxiliary Proof of Work. The extra data appears between the nonce and txn_count. This extra data appears when a block has been merged-mined for both the Bitcoin and Namecoin networks. It is important to note that a Namecoin block after block 19200 may not be merged-mined, though most are.</p>

    <p>I recently installed the program nmcontrol. Doing so was non-trivial, so I am documenting the process I took here. For those that don&rsquo;t know, nmcontrol is a daemon that communicates with namecoind and provides services. In particular, I wanted to use the DNS service it provides for accessing .bit domain names. The .bit TLD is used by Namecoin. Namecoin is a decentalized key-value store and among its uses is decentalized DNS.</p>

    <p>I got my first package uploaded to Debian this week. That package is winetricks. It was orphaned and I adopted it. Now the lastest version (0.0+20140818+svn1202) is available in sid and should migrate to testing in nine days. I moved the vcs from collab-maint to a personal repo, since I don&rsquo;t have access to collab-maint. I also have a sponsor for slowaes. It is also a package that was orphaned that I am adopting.</p>

    <p>Debconf14 was the first Debconf I attended. It was an awesome experience. Debconf14 started with a Meet and Greet before the Welcome Talk. I got to meet people and find out what they do for Debian. I also got to meet other GSoC students that I had only previously interacted with online. During the Meet and Greet I also met one of my mentors for GSoC, Zack. Later in the conference I met another of my mentors, Piotr.</p>

    <p>It has been a couple of months since my last GSoC update and a lot has happened since then. You can view the web interface at metrics.debian.net. There is a dynamic interface viewable with JavaScript enabled, and a static interface viewable with JS disabled. I am currently working on the dynamic interface. In the weeks since my last blog post I have accomplished a lot. There is support for pull and push metrics.</p>

    <p>A couple days ago I received my welcome package from Google. The welcome package included a pen and a notepad that has stickers. Since my last update I got the repo setup and started working on the specifications. I have been emailing with my mentors to work out the specs. You can view the git repo. To keep up to date on my progress, you can either read this blog, or you can read the soc-corrdination mailing list once coding starts on the 19th.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I found out that I was accepted into the Google Summer of Code program. I was accepted by Debian and will be working on a Metrics Portal. You can view the announcement on the Debian blog. The Metrics Portal will have a database that stores historical data on Debian. It will have an interface to add/remove metrics and a web interface to show the metrics graphically. It will utilize cron jobs to update the metrics and generate graphs.</p>
